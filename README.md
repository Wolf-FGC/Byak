Byak Oki Scripts - 1st Draft


This is pretty basic but it could help one or two of you out there. Each script starts with 623C web, it sets some webs and then does something different on your wakeup. If you don't know how to use the editor, reach out to me and I'll show you but the instructions for it are pretty nice and straightforward. Select 5 scenarios for Byak-bot to do, override the dummy slots with the scripts and turn off Display Dummy Playback Time. Don't forget to turn Random Dummy Playback on.

Eventually I'll string more of these together into longer scripts with better pressure. If you also play Byakuya and have some input, I'll incorporate that into future iterations.
Have fun.
